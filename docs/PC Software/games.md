## General Torrent

**[1337x](https://1337x.to) (Torrent)**

A very popular Torrenting site which has an incredible amount of content, but also has major downsides including a bad moderation team (Not banning uploaders who uploaded malware in the past) and an incredibly unsafe Software category (Don't get Software releases from this site). **Note: Stay away from Torrents marked IGGGAMES, xGIROx, Seyter, Qoob, nosTEAM and CorePack.**

**[RARBG](https://rarbg.to) (Torrent)**

A very safe site to get Games from, mostly scene releases which they automatically upload using Bots. If you use a VPN get ready to solve CAPTCHAs.

## Repackers

**[FitGirl](https://fitgirl-repacks.site) (Torrent / DDL)**

The most well known and reputable repacker out there, very active and provides torrent links with DDL mirrors. The only downside being the repacks can take a long time to install depending on your hardware.

**[DODI](https://dodi-repacks.site) (Torrent / DDL)**

Another active repacker that provides torrent links with DDL mirrors. Usually takes shorter to install compared to FitGirl, having slightly bigger releases.

**[Masquerade](https://masquerade.site) (DDL / *Torrent*)**

Known repacker that focuses more on indie titles and mostly uses google drive as the main downloading option.  
*Only some Repacks have Torrent options.

**[xatab](https://xatab-repack.com) (Torrent)**

One of the oldest and most respected Repackers that passed away recently. His site is currently reposting from other sources but his older Releases can still be found here. **RIP.**

## Mirrors

**[OvaGames](https://ovagames.com) (DDL / Torrent)**

A site which focuses on reuploading Repacks, P2P cracks, Scene releases and GOG rips on multiple mirrors. They take requests too.

**[CrackHub](https://crackhub.site) (DDL)**

Another site that mainly focuses on reuploading to different hosts, they take requests. It also has an automatic Scene upload Bot which uploads to Zippyshare [here](https://scene.crackhub.site).

**[GamesDrive](https://gamesdrive.net) (DDL)**

Another site that reuploads Repacks, P2P cracks and Scene Releases to various hosts.

## Forums

**[cs.rin.ru](https://cs.rin.ru/forum) (Torrent links / DDL)**

Arguably the best site to download from. It's a well moderated Forum with active members. Not only good for getting Games from but also learning about different Piracy tools as well.

**[Torrminatorr](https://forum.torrminatorr.com) (Torrent / DDL)**

Another well moderated forum with active uploaders and discussions.

## Misc

**[Online-Fix](https://online-fix.me) (DDL / Torrent)**

Any cracked game that has multiplayer (usually on Steam) you will most likely find it here done by their own cracker, 0xDeadCode. Also their site has very strong measures against Ad-Blockers.
