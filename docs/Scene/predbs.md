description: Scene Release Databases

**Wait, what is a PreDB?**  
As listed in the [**Scene Glossary**](https://ripped.guide/Scene/scene-glossary/), 
> A database with all release titles. These release titles are not for download, they are just records. Apart from the release title, a record often also contains the release size, release date, and sometimes also NFO's. With commands one is able to 'check' a release.

That said, here's some Pre-Database sites to check for releases.

**[PreDB.org](https://www.predb.org/)**  
**[PreDB.de](https://predb.de/)**  
**[PreDB.ovh](https://predb.ovh/)**  
**[PreDB.live](https://predb.live/)**  
**[PreDB.me](https://predb.me/)**  

## Honorable Mention
**[CrackWatch](https://crackwatch.com/)**  
Instead of being a automatic feed, Crackwatch has user-submitted releases with their only focus being Games.
